## Entry 001: Initial Scaffold, Quota Interruption & Resume-by-Audit
- **Date**: 2026-09-13
- **Author**: Engineering Team / Orchestrator Agent
- **Milestone**: v0.1 Bootstrap & Resumption

### Summary of Events
1. **Initial Scaffold**: Created the core Streamlit application skeleton (`app.py`), project dependencies (`requirements.txt`), project configuration (`.gitignore`, `.env.example`), and documentation (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`).
2. **Quota Interruption**: Development workflow was temporarily paused due to API quota constraints on upstream language models.
3. **Resume-by-Audit**: Upon resumption, executed a strict audit of existing project artifacts (`app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`) to verify state before proceeding. Established the principle that unexpected interruptions must always be recovered via non-destructive state auditing rather than blind overwriting.
4. **Documentation Completion**: Completed missing governance and architecture tracking docs (`docs/ROADMAP.md` and `docs/DEVLOG.md`).
